# Homework 2: Deep Learning Models and Report

In this repository, you will find the implemented models and a comprehensive report for Homework 2. The main focus of the assignment is on building and evaluating Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet), and Residual Network (ResNet) models.

## 📁 Repository Content

### 📓 Jupyter Notebooks

- [`hw2_dnn.ipynb`](hw2_dnn.ipynb): Implementation, training, and evaluation of the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model.
  
- [`hw2_convnet.ipynb`](hw2_convnet.ipynb): Implementation, training, and evaluation of the Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) model.
  
- [`hw2_resnet.ipynb`](hw2_resnet.ipynb): Implementation, training, and evaluation of the Residual Network (ResNet) model.

### 📄 Report

- [`hw2_report.pdf`](hw2_report.pdf): A detailed report providing insights into the methodology, experimental setups, results, and analysis for each model implemented in the Jupyter Notebooks.

### 📸 Result Screenshots 

- 📁 [`resnet_result_screenshots`](resnet_result_screenshots): This folder contains various screenshots capturing notable results and visualization from the ResNet model.

## 🚀 Getting Started
